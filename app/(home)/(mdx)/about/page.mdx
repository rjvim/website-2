Hello! I am Rajiv, a software engineer and entrepreneur.

I have been helping founders take their ideas to market since 2016. My work predominantly was with first time founders who haven't raised funding yet and want to go to market with a production read application(s).

I always loved the challenge of doing things with limited resources - its a puzzle of putting together a tech stack which gives ability to build applications, scale them and also keep costs low till it the product finds its market fit. I like to view myself as a "full stack product and engineering tech guy", because the problem starts at product and delivered by a realistic tech stack engineered to sustain.

I built apps in various domains like Edutech, Real Estate, SaaS, Wealth Tech, Finance, Banking, and some are purely fun projects, and unique ideas.

The posts which I am writing on this blog give more details on what I worked on.

This is not a detailed post on how visualize product and engineering coming together and make things happen - but simply put - every decision is a product decision including where and how you host your software. And I particularly like the entire journey of this.

I share failures, disasters, successes from various different lenses.

And finally, a shameless plug - hire me to design and architect your product and engineering stack, or just let's connect.
